### 21/10/12

#### Changes

Added a changelog :D
Changed how "Eyeposes" are stored from large multidimension uint16_t matrices to nifty 8-unit uint32_t arrays using bitRead();

#### Known Issues

So far? Just that it's not finished!

#### ToDo

Clean up existing code: refactor variables and remove old code
Add EyePoses: Angry face.
Fix like, all of the earposes.... They're currently mostly placeholders. But they "work"
