# PuppyBot

This is supposed to be some arduino code for a little LED display and some servo motors to make eyes and ears respectively

The eyes will have this little blink blink, thing, and they can make some faces
and the ears will twitch or droop or come to attention

I'm working on cleaning this up. updates will be frequent.
I am still learning.
